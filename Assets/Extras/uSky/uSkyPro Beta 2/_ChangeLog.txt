uSky 1.1.9f3 Change Log
=======================
- Added uSkyPro Mobile Material (SM 2.0), this shader is roughly 4 times faster the original shader.
Usage: Apply the "uSkyboxPro Mobile SM2" Material to "Skybox Material" field in uSkyPro.

// LIMITATION OF MOBILE SHADER:
//
// Supports only Altitude Sample X1 
// No calculation of camera position 
// No Altitude Scale
// Always at ground/sea level camera view from the sky
// Always disabled skybox ocean effect
// No earth shadow
// No Moon Corona
//
// Ported Unity Photographic tonemapping formular for skybox :
// - Sky color is more saturated then original color
// - Slightly darker on Zenith (top of the sky)

- Fixed the uSkyPro script error when apply to a new game object.

- Renamed "Play Cycle" settings to "Day Night Cycle".



HotFix (v1.1.9f2):
==================
Fixed when the scene applied with uSkyPro prefab, uSkyboxPro material is completely back and Undo is broken with uSkyPro.



uSkyPro Beta 2 :
=======================

- Added new user-interface with foldable group settings. 
  (New Interface is based on Unity "Cinematic Image Effects" PropertyDrawer script)

- Added new script "uSkyTimeline" which combined the final "Timeline" control with "Play Cycle" in a single component.
  Renamed the "North Pole Offset" parameter to "Sun Equator Offset". 
  Now it allows user to change the Timeline even when time cycle is playing at runtime.

- Rewritten the internal logic of the uSkyPro and more polished version. Now it is using unity event which acting like a states machine.
  This new logic is fairly fast, responsive, more stable and running lower update behaviour on cpu.

- Now most of the uSky components allow to work independently by it-self. User can decide which component to add or remove with GameObject.
  Ideally this will be easier to intergrade uSkyPro with other third-party or custom weather asset.
  For instance, user can add just only "uSkyTimeline" component to a GameObject and with "uSkySun" component in Directional light,
  it will work as the time cycle and sun controller.
  For more different components usage or combination that please check out the example scenes in new "Alternative Component Setup Demo" folder.

- Added a new and improved version of "uSkyReflectionProbeUpdater" script for Reflection Probe update control .
  This new script does not require to enable "Auto" toggle (in Lighting Window) anymore for Reflection Probe sequence update in both editor and runtime.

- Added a new "uSkyFogGradient" script for unity built-in fog in Lighting window. It supports on both Forward and Deferred path.
  (It provides the same function as "uFogGradient" script in previous uSky 1.x.)

- Fixed the atmospheric occlusion with "out of the shadow range" issue with better solution. (Previous was using the Shadow Distance Scale solution).
  Now the atmospheric occlusion effect will fade out nicely when camera is out side the realtime shadow distance range.
  Also cleared occlusion shader compiler warning on d3d11.

- Changed and simplified "uSky Atmospheric Scattering" script:
  Removed "Horizion Fixup" parameter. Now hard coded "#define HORIZON_FIX" in the "Atmosphere.cginc" file which default is "ON".
  Removed "Shadow Distance" parameter and "Use Shadow Distance Scale" toggle. Both of them are not needed anymore.
  User can apply also an optional "ShadowDistanceHelper" script for alternative shadow distance control.

- Reduced some shader Keywords.
  Now uSkyPro Beta uses arround 5 keywords and they share some Keywords with uSky 1.x to keep the lower usage in total keywords if user installed both version in the project.
  So total for both version of uSky use arround 7 keywords now.
  Note: The total keywords amount may change in future version.

- Changed the sun spot rendering in uSkyboxPro shader, the sun brightness will always higher than 1 which independent by HDR Mode setting.
  It should get better result for bloom image effect.

- Fixed and cleared the "uSkySun" and "uSkyMoon" editor warning when built the project.

- Added "[ImageEffectAllowedInSceneView]" attribute in Atmospheric Scattering Image Effects which introduced in Unity 5.4 (Beta 5). 
  This will copy the Image effect from the main camera onto the Scene View camera that allows to view the Image Effects directly inside editor Scene View window.

- Re-organized the uSkyPro menu and easily to find all the uSkyPro components now.

- Improved over all performance compares with previous beta version.


***  New clouds system for uSkyPro is still working in progress. Please be patient for future update :)
