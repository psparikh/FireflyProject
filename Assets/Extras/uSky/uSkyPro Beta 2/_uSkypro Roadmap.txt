uSkypro RoadMap:
-----------------
To Do List:

- Support SphericalHarmonics ambient lighting with custom ground color control. 
Ambient lighting will always automatically synchronize with the skybox color when changed.
Support SphericalHarmonics both in editor and runtime.
(Due to new skybox there does not have ground color on it, and it will not produce correct ambient if use skybox ambient mode. 
So currently limited to use the manual "Ambient Gradients" only for ambient lighting.)

- Add and improve clouds rendering with atmosphere scattering and occlusion.
(Additional fogginess control in sky (skybox) and atmosphere scattering.)

- Add Horizion Fog control for Height fog feature.

- Basic Lensfare for the sun spot.

- Mobile version of the uSkypro skybox material.

- Moon Phase feature.


Add Extra Feature Plan:
----------------------
- LightShaft (ImageEffects) with full sky occlusion.



Optional Plan:
--------------
- Support bake full Day/Night cycle of the reflection probe. 
No need to do the realtime rendering of the reflection cubemap.

Limitation
---------------

- Not supports skybox ambient (SphericalHarmonics).
Due to new skybox there does not have gound color on it, and it will not produce correct ambient if use skybox ambient mode. 
So currently limited to use the manual "Ambient Gradients" only for ambient lighting.)

- Not supports the WebGL build.
